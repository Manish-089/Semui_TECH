## Solution
To address the problem:
1. **Data Collection**: Used the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset with accelerometer and gyroscope data from 30 individuals.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracted statistical features such as mean and standard deviation from the sensor data.
3. **Model Selection**: Implemented a Random Forest Classifier to analyze and classify gait patterns.
4. **Authentication**: Compared live gait data with stored patterns for each employee to determine access.

## Dataset
The project uses the UCI Human Activity Recognition dataset:
- **Training Data**: Contains labeled accelerometer readings for model training.
- **Test Data**: Used to evaluate the system's performance.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: The system achieved 94% accuracy in identifying individuals.
- **Precision and Recall**: Both metrics demonstrated the reliability of the model in practical scenarios.
